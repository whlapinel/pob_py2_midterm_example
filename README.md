# Example project to help give students ideas on how to complete the midterm project

## Please note, this code goes **way beyond** the requirements of the project in some ways but does not meet all requirements in others

### **Way Beyond**: There is a lot of extra stuff in this code and if it's too confusing, you are completely fine doing it a simpler way. I have written this to give you ideas as to how you might do things in a way similar to how it might be done in the real world, but you don't have to do it this way

### **Not enough**: I only have the Student class here and it only has 2 fields. Your classes will need to have more attributes and you'll need more than one class, for example

- For the library idea: books, library, check in, check out, etc.
- For the bank idea: account, user, deposit, withdrawal, etc.
